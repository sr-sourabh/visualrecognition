# Convolutional Neural Network

We implement

* A CNN with fair depth and suggest a good architecture to increase accuracy of our model
    1. Compare models with different number of convolution layers ans fully connected layers for accuracy and training
       time
    2. SGD (Stochastic gradient descent) training with batch normalization
    3. SGD with adaptive learning rate
    4. SGD with momentum
    5. SGD with mini batch
    6. Final best architecture to achieve good results


* We will be using CIFAR-10 dataset for our experiments


* Use transfer learning on top of ALexNet
    1. Without fine tuning
    2. With fine tuning
